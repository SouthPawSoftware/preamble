{"name":"Preamble","tagline":"A Powerful JavaScript Unit Testing Framework","body":"### Introducing Preamble\r\nPreamble is a powerful JavaScript unit testing framework that runs in any modern HTML5 compliant browser. Preamble is backed by a very powerful assertion engine that your tests interface with through a very simple to use but powerful API, which makes authoring tests very easy and intuitive.\r\nHere, for example, you can see how easy it is to write a synchronous test:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n    Preamble.group('truthy', function(){\r\n        Preamble.test('true === true', function(assert){\r\n            assert.isTrue(true === true, 'true === true');\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n### Getting started with Preamble\r\nGetting started with Preamble is as easy as cloning the repo, changing to the directory in which the repo was cloned into, adding your test script or scripts to the index.html page and running index.html in your browser.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n<head>\r\n    <title>Preamble</title>\r\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\r\n    <link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lora' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>\r\n    <link href='style/preamble.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n    <header>\r\n        <h1 id=\"header\">Name your tests here</h1>\r\n    </header>\r\n    <div class=\"container\">\r\n        <section id=\"status-container\"> </section>\r\n        <section id=\"results-container\"></section>\r\n        <div id=\"test-container\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <!-- JavaScripts Go Here -->\r\n\r\n    <!-- code and libraries needed to run tests go here -->\r\n\r\n    <!-- preamble-config.js file has to be loaded before preamble.js is loaded!!! -->\r\n    <!--\r\n    <script src=\"javascripts/preamble-config.js\"></script>\r\n    -->\r\n\r\n    <!-- preamble.js -->\r\n    <script src=\"javascripts/libs/preamble.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n    <!-- test scripts follow preamble.js -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n#API\r\n\r\n### group(label, callback)\r\nA group is used to define a group of tests. **label** is a string used to uniquely identify the group and **callback** is a function which contains one or more tests. Besides containing tests, **callback** also provides closure so any code or values that are defined within the callback function are all in the tests' scope.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n    Preamble.group('one, two, three', function(){\r\n        var one = 1;\r\n        var two = function(){return 2;};\r\n        Preamble.test('one === 1', function(assert){\r\n            assert.isTrue(one === 1, 'one does equal 1');\r\n        });\r\n        Preamble.test('two === 2', function(assert){\r\n            assert.isTrue(two() === 2, 'two() does equal 2');\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n### test(label, callback)\r\nA test is used to define one or more assertions. **label** is a string used to uniquely identify the test and **callback** is a function which contains one or more assertions. Besides containing assertions, **callback** also provides closure so any code or values that are defined within the callback function are all in the assertions' scope.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
