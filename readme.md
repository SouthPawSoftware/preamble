# Preamble v3.0.0-rc1

### JavaScript Testing Framework

**_Preamble v3 (Pern)_** is a powerful JavaScript testing framework backed by a powerful assertion engine that your test scripts interface with through a simple to use but powerful API. Preamble makes the task of authoring tests easy, intuitive and even fun.

**_Preamble v3 (Pern)_** introduces numerous new API features and enhancements:
1. a rich BDD semantic api
2. improved support for test doubles spies and stubs as well as new support for mocks.

** Preamble v3.0.0-rc1 ** is a work in progress and made available as a prerelease for developer engagement and feedback. The actual release version may or may not be exactly the same but will not radicaly diverge either.

** Breaking Changes **

Because of the nature of the features that have been added in v3, _test scripts written for previous versions will not work with v3_. In addition, _numerous APIs have been changed or removed entirely_. This was unfortunate but absolutely necessary in order to move Preamble forward. Please read the documentation for complete details.
