# Preamble v2.1.0
### JavaScript Testing Framework

**_Preamble v2 (Ramoth)_** is a powerful JavaScript testing framework backed by a powerful assertion engine that your test scripts interface with through a simple to use but powerful API. Preamble makes the task of authoring tests easy, intuitive and even fun.

**_Preamble v2 (Ramoth)_** represents a total rewrite from Preamble's previous version and introduces numerous new API features and enhancements.

Test scripts written for previous versions _will not work with v2_. This was unfortunate but absolutely necessary in order to move Preamble forward. Please read the documentation for complete details.
