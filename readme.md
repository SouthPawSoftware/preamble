# Preamble v2.0.0 (Ramoth)
### JavaScript Testing Framework

Preamble _v2.0.0 (Ramoth)_ is a powerful JavaScript testing framework backed by a powerful assertion engine that your test scripts interface with through a simple to use but powerful API. Preamble makes the task of authoring tests easy, intuitive and even fun.

This release represents a total rewrite from Preamble's previous version and introduces numerous new API features and enhancements. Test scripts written for previous versions will not work with v2. This was unfortunate but absolutely necessary in order to move Preamble forward. Please read the documentation for complete details.
